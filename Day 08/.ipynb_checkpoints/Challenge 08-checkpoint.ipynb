    "# --- Day 8: Treetop Tree House ---\n",
    "The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid. The Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort. Now, they're curious if this would be a good location for a __tree house__.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, determine whether there is enough tree cover here to keep a tree house __hidden__. To do this, you need to count the number of trees that are __visible from outside the grid__ when looking directly along a row or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves have already launched a __quadcopter__ to generate a map with the height of each tree (your puzzle input). For example:\n",

    "Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where `0` is the shortest and `9` is the tallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree is __visible__ if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are __shorter__ than it. Only consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the trees around the edge of the grid are visible - since they are already on the edge, there are no trees to block the view. In this example, that only leaves the interior nine trees to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The top-left `5` is visible from the left and top. (It isn't visible from the right or bottom since other trees of height `5` are in the way.)   \n",
    "+ The top-middle `5` is visible from the top and right.   \n",
    "+ The top-right `1` is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to only be trees of height `0` between it and an edge.   \n",
    "+ The left-middle `5` is visible, but only from the right.   \n",
    "+ The center `3` is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to be only trees of at most height `2` between it and an edge.   \n",
    "+ The right-middle `3` is visible from the right.   \n",
    "+ In the bottom row, the middle `5` is visible, but the `3` and `4` are not.      \n",
