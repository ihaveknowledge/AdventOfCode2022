# AdventOfCode2022
This is the repository for my Advent of Code work 2022. This is my first year doing working on the Advent of Code and I will be working through this with members of my team in Lambeth Council.

I am also learning how to work with Git using bash and Visual Studio Code to update the repo.

To access Advent of code go to __https://adventofcode.com/2022__ and sign up.

This year's advent fo code will be work through using Python. I am looking to increase my practical knowledge of Python by improving my knowledge of data structures and functional programming.
